# JPG-to-PNG-converter
For this project I used the SYS and OS functions as well as the Pillow module for image processing. With these tools I made a program that will convert your jpg images to png and save them in a new folder. 
To use this program:
1)	Download PIL library to your computer
2)	Put all of your jpg images that you want converted to png in one folder and put that folder in the same folder as the downloaded code
3)	In the command line you will give 3 arguments: the first one will run the code, the second will be the name of the file you have your jpg images are stored in and the third will be the name of the file you want the new converted images saved in ex: python official_jpgtopgn.py pics/ png_pics/
